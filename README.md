# com_jobApplications
Joomla 3.3 component that organizes job applications into a view-able format on the backend of Joomla. 

To start add the following link to any part of the website and follow it. 
index.php?option=com_jobapplications

This link is on the site part of the website where users can apply.

Any application can be viewed in the backend using job-applications in components.

The job-application form takes a resume (pdf, doc, and txt). 

This component is still under development, but feel free to contribute to it.
